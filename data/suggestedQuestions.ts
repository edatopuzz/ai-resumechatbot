    question: "How did Eda lead the AI Skills project at SAP SuccessFactors?",
    answer: `Eda built the AI Skills initiative from 0 to 1, delivering three transformative capabilities: AI Resume Skills Matching (matching candidates to jobs based on extracted skills), Skills Cloud (an interactive visualization of skills alignment), and Similar Jobs (showcasing related jobs through similarity scoring).
She architected the core matching algorithms in close partnership with engineering, designing for precision in skill relevance, profession alignment, and boosting logic to ensure every match felt intuitive and meaningful to users. At the same time, she led collaboration with UX and UX Research to craft user experiences that felt effortless and powerful, validating designs through rapid, iterative testing loops.
Understanding that trust would be critical for adoption, Eda proactively partnered with the Data Privacy team to embed GDPR-compliant consent frameworks into the user flow from day one.
Owning the full product lifecycle — from vision to execution — Eda aligned engineering, UX, and compliance around a unified strategy. Her leadership ensured the AI Skills system not only scaled technically, but also earned user trust and created true product delight.
This initiative reflects Eda's ability to think end-to-end: bridging technical depth, user advocacy, and strategic execution to bring bold, high-impact products to life.`

    question: "What was Project Unify and what was Eda's impact?",
    answer: `Project Unify was a major initiative to modernize how SAP SuccessFactors' Recruiting Marketing (RMK) platform accessed job requisition data. Historically, RMK — originally the acquired Jobs2Web product — had limited access to Recruiting Management (RCM) data, requiring manual transfers and restricting search capabilities for customers.
Eda led Project Unify on the RMK side, driving the shift to real-time APIs that pulled complete, up-to-date requisition data directly from RCM. This eliminated the need for maintenance jobs and unlocked richer search, better performance, and full access to requisition fields.
Building on this foundation, Eda led the launch of major new features, including advanced search filters, redesigned job result cards, an improved job alert experience, and updated job detail layouts — all designed to elevate the candidate experience.
She also launched the Interactive Job Map, partnering closely with UX teams to create a dynamic, intuitive way for candidates to explore jobs by location.
To accelerate adoption, Eda hosted customer webinars showcasing these innovations, helping drive a 220% increase in Career Site Builder adoption.`
