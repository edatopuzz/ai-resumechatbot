    question: "What is Eda's current role at SAP SuccessFactors?",
    answer: "Eda is a Product Manager II at SAP SuccessFactors, where she owns Career Site Builder — the platform that powers how 4,000+ global enterprises launch branded career sites, publish jobs at scale, and deliver personalized job discovery to millions of candidates. Within CSB, she's shipped multiple 0-to-1 product suites, including the AI Skills system (resume matching, explainable skills graphs, and job recommendations), which scaled to 1M+ API calls/month across 1,000+ customers in its first year. She also led Project Unify, a full-stack infrastructure overhaul that cut latency by 65%, unlocked 80% more structured data, and drove a 220% increase in platform adoption in six months. Before SAP, Eda built AI Sourcer from concept to production at an early-stage B2B recruiting AI startup — a machine learning recommendation engine that automated candidate sourcing. She also launched a Chrome extension for recruiter outreach and ran growth experiments that boosted acquisition by 43%. Eda's product work blends AI, UX, and systems thinking — always focused on building intelligent, scalable tools grounded in human-centered design."

    question: "How did Eda lead the AI Skills project at SAP SuccessFactors?",
    answer: "Eda led the full product lifecycle for AI Skills system — a 0-to-1 product suite that reimagined skills-based job discovery for global enterprises. She moved candidates from keyword search to intelligent, skill-driven discovery and scaled the system to over 1 million API calls per month across more than 1,000 customers within its first year. The suite included AI Resume Matching for skill extraction and scoring, Skills Cloud for explainability, and Similar Jobs, a recommendation engine powered by profession-aware similarity scoring. Eda delivered these features through rapid sprint cycles and close collaboration with engineering, UX, and compliance. To improve match precision, she reweighted key skill signals by 5x and refined scoring logic — leading to a 60 percent boost in accuracy. On the growth side, she ran 15+ A/B tests on onboarding flows, resulting in an 18 percent increase in conversions from resume upload to application. She also partnered with legal and privacy stakeholders to ensure the system was fully GDPR-compliant consent frameworks from day one, enabling rollout in 25+ countries without delay. It was a systems-level build — combining infrastructure, design, privacy, and growth into a product that moved enterprise hiring from keyword matching to skills-based discovery. This initiative reflects Eda's ability to think end-to-end: bridging technical depth, user advocacy, and strategic execution to bring bold, high-impact products to life."

    question: "What was Project Unify and what was Eda's impact?",
    answer: "Project Unify was a full-stack rebuild of SAP's Recruiting Marketing (RMK) platform. It replaced legacy batch jobs with real-time APIs, giving customers access to complete, up-to-date data they could actually use. The shift enabled faster, more accurate, and personalized job search across over 4,000 global enterprise sites. Before Unify, RMK had limited access to core requisition data from SAP's Recruiting Management system. Every update required overnight sync jobs, which slowed performance and constrained search capabilities. Eda led the overhaul on the RMK side, unlocking 80 percent more structured data and reducing latency by 65 percent. With the new architecture in place, she shipped critical UX upgrades including faceted filters, redesigned result cards, real-time job alerts, and an Interactive Job Map that boosted apply rates by 28 percent for location-based roles. These enhancements led to a 35 percent overall lift in job applies across customer career sites. To drive adoption, Eda led the go-to-market strategy hands-on. She hosted more than 10 enterprise webinars, built migration tools, and onboarded Fortune 500 clients directly. Her efforts resulted in a 220 percent increase in Career Site Builder adoption within six months. It was a product-led transformation across infrastructure, UX, and customer growth, and Eda led her team through it end to end."

She built in real-time feedback loops to continuously improve match quality, ran over 10 user interviews to shape the MVP, and shipped 15+ features in just four months through tight, iterative sprints. She also led growth initiatives end-to-end. Eda launched a Chrome extension that boosted user acquisition by 43 percent and ran targeted A/B tests on messaging, UX, and outreach campaigns that drove a 63 percent increase in email and LinkedIn CTR. She partnered closely with engineering, design, and sales while owning execution across product, growth, and go-to-market — sharpening the core skills she brings to product management today."

    question: "How has Eda demonstrated leadership and mentorship?",
    answer: "Eda leads by building systems that scale people. At Claremont McKenna, she founded Product Space, the college's first product management fellowship. She led a five-person executive team, created a weekly, skills-based curriculum, and secured 12+ company partnerships to give students access to real product challenges. In its first semester, the program placed 28 students, and 80 percent of their projects were implemented by partner orgs — turning campus talent into real-world product impact. Earlier, Eda brought the Technovation Challenge to rural Turkey, launching a coding bootcamp for high school girls in underserved regions. She taught students how to design, build, and ship mobile apps. This initiative blended technical education with mentorship, creating new career pathways for girls in communities with limited access to tech. Her leadership style is product-driven: identify a need, build the system, and help others rise. Whether she's scaling a program or leading a team, she delivers structure, energy, and outcomes that lift people up and keep compounding."

She conducted usability studies, interviewed 18 stakeholders, and guided her team through prototyping solutions to address key user pain points. Their work resulted in the development of an online platform that was later adopted by educational institutions in the U.S. and China. This experience strengthened Eda's leadership in user research, human-centered design, and building solutions rooted in real user needs."
